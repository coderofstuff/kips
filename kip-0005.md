# Motivation
Signing messages provides a mechanism for proving access to a given address without revealing your private keys.
This paves the way for proving ownership of funds, native assets (not implemented yet) among many possible use-cases.

# Specifications

## Signing a message

This part of the process is relevant to applications that have access to the private key
and will sign some message.

Given:
- A string of arbitrary length. We'll call this `raw_message`
- A `private_key`

Output: signature associated with that string with some given private key

1. Hash the message using Blake2B. To ensure this has will never collide with a transaction input hash, use a different Blake2B key
`PersonalMessageSigningHash` (Transaction hashes uses `TransactionSigningHash` as key to blake2b)
2. Schnorr sign the hashed message

In summary: `schnorr_sign(blake2b(raw_message, key='PersonalMessageSigningHash'), private_key)`

## Verifying a message signature

This part of the process is relevant to applications that is asking some public_key owner
to provide evidence that they have access to the private_key of this public_key.

Given:
- A string of arbitrary length. We'll call this `raw_message`
- A `public_key` which the application has asked to sign the message

Output: `true` if the signature is valid, `false` otherwise

1. Hash the raw message in the same way as above for signing
2. Schnorr verify the signature matches the `public_key` you are testing for

In summary: `schnorr_sign(blake2b(raw_message, key='PersonalMessageSigningHash'), private_key)`

# Sample Implementation

```
from hashlib import blake2b
from secp256k1 import PublicKey, PrivateKey

# Assume we have a private-public key pair
# some_secret_key (private) and some_public_key (public)

def hash_init() -> blake2b:
    return blake2b(digest_size=32, key=bytes("PersonalMessageSigningHash", "ascii"))

def sign_message(raw_message) -> bytes:
    message_hash = hash_init()
    message_hash.update(raw_message)
    
    message_digest = message_hash.digest()

    return PrivateKey(some_secret_key).schnorr_sign(message_digest, None)

def verify_message_signature(raw_message, message_signature) -> bool:
    message_hash = hash_init()
    message_hash.update(raw_message)
    
    message_digest = message_hash.digest()

    return PublicKey(some_public_key).schnorr_verify(message_digest, message_signature, None)
